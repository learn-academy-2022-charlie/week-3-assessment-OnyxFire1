# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Based on my understanding of 'this' keyword sits inside the code that defines the class.

  Researched answer: The this keyword in JavaScript alludes to an object, which object will depends on how the this keyword is called, 'this' can be referred to different objects based on how it is used. In a fuction it is a global object, in an event it refers to the element in receipt of it, and in an object method it refers to the object.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is how we interact with websites by displaying user interactions.

  Researched answer: React was created by Facebook, it is used to help developers build user interfaces as a structure of small pieces called components. A component is a combination of HTML and JavaScript that catches all of the logic that are in need of displaying a small segment of a larger user interface. Each of these components can be built up into back-to-back compounded parts of an app.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Render is the only lifecycle method required.

  Researched answer: The lifecycle in React can be monitored and manipulated. The render class method works in smart, class components only and displays the code that will go within the empty div after it is render from JSX.



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JavaScript XML is a combination of JavaScritpt and HTML.

  Researched answer: JSX allows us to write HTML in React, it makes it easier to write and add HTML in React. As an add-on to JS it comes up with a way to shape component rendering using known syntax.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that creates the file structure of a React app and manages the dependencies.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the functionality for other package managers while remaining compatible. It has the same characteristics set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.

The primary function of any package manager is to install some package — a piece of code that serves a particular purpose — from a global registry into a local environment. Each package may or may not depend on other packages. A typical project could have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of packages within its tree of dependencies.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: A nameless function.

  Researched answer: An anonymous function does not have any name connected with it, only the function keyword without the fucntion name is used.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. 

2. Object-oriented programming: A computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

3. Ruby: A dynamic programming language that focuses on simplicity and productivity.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby has anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. They are called blocks. Blocks can be created with the do/end keywords OR with {}. Blocks are code that is passed to a method.

5. Ruby hashes: A container for data, the data is stored in key value pairs.
